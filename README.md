## Project Euler Problem Solutions



Project Euler, named after the great mathematician Leonhard Euler is a mathematical problem website created by Colin Hughes in 2001. The site contains problems of different levels of difficulty, whose solution requires knowledge of mathematics and programming. As a math and programming enjoyer, I created this repository, with the solutions of the exercises that I came to solve.
