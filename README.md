<h1>E-learning Portfolio</h1>

<h2>About:</h2>

I created this repository with the purpose of storing and also being a showcase for the certificates of the courses I take.

As I take many online courses and end up receiving dozens of certificates, I wanted a space to display them, as I believe it is a way to show the progress in my studies, but since I don't want to clutter my LinkedIn profile, so I'm going to put them here.
